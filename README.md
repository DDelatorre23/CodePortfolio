# CodePortfolio
This is a repository to store some examples of past work I have completed throughout my time at LCC while I worked towards my Programming AAS degree.


#blackjack
This blackjack game was created as an Asp.Net website. 

#CommunityWebSite
This is a Asp.Net MVC core application I am working on for my Asp.net web development class. It is still
a work in progress and will eventually add Identity, Authorization and Authentication. 

#EvaluationApp
Asp.Net web app that utilizes Entity framework. I no longer have access to the database, however I 
recieved high praise from my professor for my work on this application. 

#TypeChecker
This is a android app that I created. It is a simple app that lets a user check what pokemon types
are super effective against other types.

#PokemonDatabase_PLSQL
this is a sql database script I created in oracle. It includes procedures, functions, triggers, and the full 
database. I designed and wrote the entire database.

#PokemonSearch
This is a simple html page to show that I have some understanding of jQuery as well as consuming a 
RESTapi.
